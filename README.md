# An Algebraic Geometric Napkin
Ongoing expository project vaguely akin to the "The Napkin Project". The motivations and subject matter will be fairly different, however the operational philosphy is somewhat similar: exposit on things with precise concepts and defintions, but completely forgo any rigorous proofs by giving the intuitive feeling of why the theory holds (while giving appropiate appendices and references for those who want rigor). 

The name will be somewhat misleading, as the project will be steered towards the biases of my curiosities and interests, which will involve multiple facets of (algebraic) number theory and mathematical logic ( mainly model theory, homotopy type theory, and topos theory). More on this later.    

# Background
The name of the project is "An Algebraic Geometric Napkin" because it arose during my own studies of algebraic geometry. I do not have a regualrly occuring formal course in algebraic geometry at my home undergraduate instution, and so I had to bootstrap a decent portion of my learning. I was somewhat distraught regarding the various approaches to the subject I ecnountered, so I aim to make this project as accessible as possible, while synthezing various approaches, only essentially requiring basic familiarity with abstract algebra and point set topology.  

At the time I had varying levels of experience and mastery of some Riemann Surface theory, algebraic topology, commutative and homological algebra, differential topology, complex analysis, algebraic number theory, and french. Such a background provided a decent basis not in a strictly material way. Because I had seen some techniques, 

The aim of this text is not to be a reference, but rather set up basic definitions, theorems and intution in the same vein as "The Napkin" does. The difference being that I am largely curious about lots of things, some not entirely algebraic geometric, and while touching on the foundations of algeebraic geometry, this napkin will also ai 

As I am learning the basics of algebraic geometry, both through the classical, concrete perspective, as well as the more modern scheme theoretic perspective, I can't help but feel there is a good way to sythesize the two approaches. 

In turn, as a senior undegraduate, I am trying to learn and feel out different subareas of algebraic geometry as well as Moreover, although Vakil describes Algebraic Geometry as "shallow and broad", .

# Roadmap
The main project plan is to write up what things in relation to what I am currently learning (Vakil's *The Rising Sea* and [Classical Algebraic Geometry] (https://mathinmoscow.org/courses/algebraic-geometry-start-up-course/))
