# An Algebraic Geometric Napkin
Ongoing expository project vaguely akin to the [The Napkin Project](https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html). The motivations and subject matter will be fairly different, however the operational philosphy is somewhat similar: exposit on things with precise concepts and defintions, but completely forgo any compelete rigorous proofs by giving the intuitive feeling of why the theory holds (while giving appropiate appendices and references for those who want rigor). Likewise, this will project is not meant to be a rigorous primary source account one will use to learn algebraic geometry and/or related areas: it is meant to give a glimpse of what is out there for those new to the subject, those currently learning it, and, hopefully at some point, practitioners. 

The name will be somewhat misleading, as the project will be steered towards the biases of my curiosities and interests, which will involve multiple facets of (algebraic) number theory and mathematical logic (mainly model theory, homotopy type theory, and topos theory). More on this below. 

# Roadmap
My main aim right now is to write up learning in the foundations of AG: [Classical Algebraic Geometry](https://mathinmoscow.org/courses/algebraic-geometry-start-up-course/) and Vakil's [*The Rising Sea*](https://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/) and how these two different approaches relate. 

# Preqreuisites
Basic familiarity with abstract algebra and point set topology. In particular one only really needs some ring theory, basic definitions of topology, continuity, and connectedness. Familiarity with category theory is fairly desired for the topics I am interested in, but certainly not strictly necessary immediately. Lots of things can be picked up on the fly, especially with the right additional sources. 

# Background on the Project

The name of the project is "An Algebraic Geometric Napkin" because it arose during my own studies of algebraic geometry. I do not have a regularly occuring formal course in algebraic geometry at my home undergraduate instution, and so I have had to bootstrap a decent portion of my learning. I was somewhat distraught regarding the various approaches to the subject I ecnountered, so I aim to make this project as accessible as possible, while "synthezing various" approaches to the subject. 

At the time I had varying levels of experience and mastery of some Riemann Surface theory, algebraic topology, commutative and homological algebra, differential topology, complex analysis, algebraic number theory, and french. Such a background provided a decent basis not in a strictly material way. Because I had seen some related techniques, objects 

The aim of this text is not to be a reference, but rather set up basic definitions, theorems and intution in the same vein as "The Napkin" does. The difference being that I am largely curious about lots of things, some not entirely algebraic geometric. Topos theory is a good example of an area that came out of algberaic geometric ideas, but has since become its own subject. Another example of an area I have a passing interest in is be homotopy type theory: learning about its existence is what go me into pure mahtematics, and it plays a role in synthetic algebraic geometry, and connects to category theory very generally. Model theory is perhaps the most isolated, but there are still plenty of fruitful interactions of the area with algebraic geometric subjects. See [motivic integration](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/motivic+integration). 

# Organization
It will be essential to have some form of common understanding. The current plan is to have the project similar in form to the Stacks project. In content it will be much less encyclopedic, and (hopefully) have a broader aim. Since github markdown editors and displays allow latex embeddings fairly smoothly nowdays, to make development as easy as possible I will resort to using github repos directly.
