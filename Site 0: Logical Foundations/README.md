### Logical Foundations
The main aim of this site to provide the main definitions and results on category theory while referencing appropiate places to learn more and appropiate proofs. 

The secondary aim of this site is to exposit the mathematical logic pre-requisites/setup embeded in the sections of the napkin which require it. There are weirdly different language and notational conventions depending on what context of mathematical logic one works in, and I aim to develop this site to resolve any confusions.
