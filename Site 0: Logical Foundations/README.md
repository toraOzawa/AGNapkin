# Logical Foundations
### Goal 1
Define a Sheaf and provide the main definitions and results on Category Theory while referencing appropiate places to learn more and appropiate proofs. 

### Goal 2
State technical definitions and results on algebra that are at least somewhat required in learning algebraic geometry. 

### Goal 3
Exposit on the mathematical logic pre-requisites/setup embeded in the sections of the napkin which require it. There are weirdly different language and notational conventions depending on what context of mathematical logic one works in, and I aim to develop this site to resolve any confusions.
